This allows for easier and faster development/deployment of ML applications. Additionally, it gives the user the ability to containerize and deploy jobs/models without needing to understand the underlying infrastructure."

    "- **Project**: A container for organizing all of your work on a particular activity. Projects consist of metadata, source code, workflows, data and artifacts, models, triggers, and member management for user collaboration\n",
    "- **Function**: A software package with one or more methods and runtime-specific attributes (such as image, command, arguments, and environment)\n",
    "- **Workflow (Pipeline)**: Defines a functions pipeline or a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\n",
    "- **Run**: An object that contains information about an executed function. The run object is created as a result of running a function, and contains the function attributes (such as arguments, inputs, and outputs), as well the execution status and results (including links to output artifacts)\n",
    "- **Artifact**: Versioned data artifacts (such as data sets, files and models) are produced or consumed by functions, runs, and workflows"
