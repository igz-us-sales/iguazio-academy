    "- A `Feature Set` is a way to ingest data. It is essentially one-to-one with a data source (i.e. file, table, stream, etc.)\n",
    "- A `Feature Vector` is a way to retrieve data. It allows you to combine and join multiple `Feature Sets` together (i.e. a few columns from here, a few columns from there)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also another definition we need to know:\n",
    "- An `Entity` is essentially a primary key. A `Feature Set` can have one or more of these primary keys. The `Entity` is used to store the data in Key-Value format as well as by the `Feature Vector` to perform joins with other `Feature Sets`. These `Entities` are expected to be columns in the dataset."
